# Surface-Kinetic-Mechanisms

Surface and the coupled gas-phase kinetic mechanisms for heterogeneous surface reactivity. 
Current gas-phase version 2003. Different [gas-phase mechanism of the same version](../Gas-Phase)
can be employed to modify the description of secondary gas-phase reactions.
 

Two mechanism are available:
- [CVI-CVD](CVI-CVD) address pyrocarbon deposition for chemical vapor infiltration/deposition (CVI-CVD) purposes.
    Both hydrocarbon cracking and carbon loss to soot are considered. The surface kinetic mechanism can be coupled 
    to other CRECK-2003 gas-phase kinetic mechanisms.
- [Char](Char) addresses surface oxidation of char from biomass pyrolysis. 
    The surface mechanism can be coupled to other gas-phase mechanisms, but there is not
    a direct correspondence of species with the [biomass mechanism](../Solid-Phase/Biomass) still
