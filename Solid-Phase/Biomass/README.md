# Biomass-Kinetic-Mechanisms

Biomass degradation kinetic Mechanisms involving:
- biomass pyrolysis 
- volatiles secondary pyrolytic, gasification, and combustion reactivity
- char oxidation reactions
Further work is underway at CRECK modelling POLIMI to better assess secondary char 
gasification reactions, effect of ashes and introducing nitrogenated compounds.


The folders are organized by mechanism type:
- BIO_2003 is the volumetric biomass degradation mechanism coupled to the gas-phase CRECK_2003
- CHAR_2101 is the surface oxidation mechanism of char

Further details are given in the subfolders
