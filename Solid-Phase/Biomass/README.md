# Biomass-Kinetic-Mechanisms

Biomass degradation kinetic mechanisms involving both condensed-phase pyrolysis and 
secondary gas-phase reactivity of volatiles. 
The solid-phase kinetic mechanism can be coupled to other [Gas-Phase kinetic mechanisms](../../Gas-Phase) 
of the same version (current gas-phase version 2003).
Currently, surface char-oxidation is considered with a [separate heterogeneous mechanism](../../Surface-Mechanisms/Char) 

The initial composition of the biomass is obtained from biochemical analysis 
or the updated characterization procedure [(Debiagi et al, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b01753) 
based on the biomass elemental analysis. Two versions are available:
- The mechanism with only [solid reactions](Solid_only) (60 species, 32 reactions)
- The [complete mechanism](Solid_gas) with gas-phase reactions as well (650 species, 20000 reactions)
The lists of species involved in the solid-mechanism is reported in the [list_of_species_solidmechanism](List_of_species_solidmechanism.txt) file
