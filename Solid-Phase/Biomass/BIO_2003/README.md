# Biomass Kinetic Mechanism

In these folders are the CHEMKIN format files.
Two versions are availbale:
- The mechanism with only solid reaction (60 species, 32 reactions)
- The complete mechanism with gas-phase reactions as well (650 species, 20000 reactions)
The solid-phase mechanism can be coupled to other gas-phase mechanisms, 
or the complete one can be reduced with appropriate tools. Details on the biomass 
characterization procedure are given in the mentioned publications.

A 0D and 1D model of biomass pyrolysis are available through OpenSMOKE++. An anisotropic
single particle model has also been developed.

To cite the Kinetic Mechanism refer to the following publications:
- Biomass       Zou, Debiagi, Amjed, Zhai, Faravelli, Fuel 2023 (under revision) or [Debiagi et al, Production of Biofuels and Chemicals with Pyrolysis (2020)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-2732-6_2)

The present file will be updated with the development of the kinetic mechanism and to
include the history of development of the mechanism.
