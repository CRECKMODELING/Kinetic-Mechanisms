# Coal-Kinetic-Mechanisms

Coal decomposition kinetic mechanisms involving condensed-phase pyrolysis and heterogeneous char conversion. 
The mechanism includes release of nitrogen and sulfur containing species.
The initial composition of the coal is obtained from a characterization procedure based on 
coal elemental analysis [(Debiagi et al, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2020.119682) 
The lists of species involved in the current mechanism and the update with respect to 
previous versions of the mechanism is reported in the [list_of_species_solidmechanism](List_of_species_coal.NAM.txt) file
