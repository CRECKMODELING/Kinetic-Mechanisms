# CVI-CVD Kinetic-Mechanisms

Surface and Gas-phase kinetic Mechanisms for pyrocarbon deposition.  
For chemical vapor infiltration/deposition (CVI-CVD), hydrocarbon cracking 
is considered together with carbon loss to soot. Current gas-phase version 2003.
The surface kinetic mechanism can be coupled to other same version [Gas-Phase kinetic mechanisms](../../Gas-Phase).
