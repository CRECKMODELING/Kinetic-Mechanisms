# NH3_34_272

Kinetic mechanism with 34 species and 272 reactions for the pyrolysis and oxidation of NH<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mixtures. The present mechanism is not related to the CRECK_2003 but involves later versions of the kinetic mechanism.

The repository includes the CHEMKIN-formatted files (<i>chem.dat</i>, <i>therm.dat</i>, <i>tran.dat</i>) and a Cantera-ready mechanism (<i>chem_LMR-R.yaml</i>), compatible with Cantera versions &ge; 3.1.0.
